# rocket-salesforce-auth0-provider
A custom Auth0-based Auth provider to automate the use of AuthHub creadentials

## Automated
All RKT AuthHub-based integrations are handled by a single Named Credential and Auth Provider. Devs no longer need to spin up new credentials or manually set auth headers in their callouts

## Secure
No credentials are exposed in plain text via metadata and legacy named credentials are a thing of the past
